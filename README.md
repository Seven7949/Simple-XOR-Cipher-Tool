# Simple-XOR-Cipher-Tool
# 🔐 XOR Cipher Tool (Symmetric Encryption)

A beginner-friendly XOR cipher tool that lets you encrypt and decrypt text using a shared secret key.

---

## ⚡ How XOR Works

Every character in the message is XOR’d with the corresponding character in the key.
This makes a simple reversible encryption — apply XOR again with the same key and you get the original text.

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt any text message using XOR and a key
- Decrypt back using the same key
- Simple, offline, and CLI-based

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Basic bitwise operations
